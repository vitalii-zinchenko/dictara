To learn more about open source libraries we use you can use the Context7, WebSearch, node_modules or the source code in `.ai-repos`.
Also, you can clone source code for other libraries if you need so.

# Code changes workflow:

IMPORTANT: After you make changes you must run `npm run verify` to check if there are any errors, and fix all errors and warnings.
